# agLugan App
> 🚧 **Status:** In active development

agLugan is a PUV and commuter monitoring app. With this app commuters can see where they are in the map and the closest waiting shed or terminal, and they can see approaching jeeps, buses, and modern jeeps. Drivers will also benefit from this by being able to see where commuters are located beforehand, so they can plan better and cause less traffic.
